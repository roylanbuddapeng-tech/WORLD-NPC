## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Lane Mom / Reach & Rescue)

* **Role:** **frontline protector / reach controller**
* **Opener:** **Tail form** on first rage to **deflect** a key hit and hold the line at the choke.
* **Flow:** tag the brute with **glaive**, then step in with **Claws** for the extra swipe that herds foes off the safe seam; **Bite** only to self-stabilize if allies need her planted.
* **Finisher:** hip pivot, half-moon sweep; rain beads trail the blade as civilians slip past.

**Damage Flavor:** frost-silver lowlights brighten; a whisper of paw-prints appears briefly on wet glass where she anchors.

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** soft-spoken, reassuring, lightly teasing; battlefield tone turns mother-calm.
* **Ideal:** Shelter — “My line is a promise, not a dare.”
* **Bond:** keeps a cloth square scented with her child’s lavender—presses it to her wrist before patrols.
* **Flaw:** refuses to withdraw while anyone still crossing behind her.

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

A seamstress turned porter who learned balance on wet boards; when Echo nights began, she stood with nothing but work gloves and a mother’s patience—and the city handed her a glaive.

* **Lifestyle:** tidy riverside room; cooks big pots for the squad.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, community donations from shop rows she shields.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

She measures victory by **breaths saved behind her**, not the bodies in front.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** a span too wide to cover with one promise.
* **Weaknesses:** **AC 15**; vulnerable to focused ranged fire without cover.
* **Strengths:** **Rage resistances**, flexible **Beast forms** (deflect/heal/extra attack), **reach control** with glaive.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**MILF — protective, gently flirty**

> “Hands here on my belt—small steps. See? The rail is quieter already.”

If someone blushes, she chuckles: “Eyes on the line, love. The neckline is under control.”

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her bell charm warms near **forged-echo rails**—it “purrs” at counterfeits.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Three Breaths Oath:** keep a bridge open for three breaths per traveler during a mass exodus.
  2. **Claw on Glass:** someone copies her fighting marks to frame her unit.
  3. **Lavender Night:** a kid goes missing; her scent square is found on a silent span.
