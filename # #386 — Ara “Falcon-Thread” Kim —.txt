## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Overwatch Lane-Stitcher)

* **Role:** **controller / pick & pin from range**
* **Opener:** marks the choke with chalk; first arrow is **Grasping Arrow** to root the loudest brute off the safe seam.
* **Flow:** uses **Seeking Arrow** to flush skulkers or shooters, calling lanes for the team; **Action Surge** to double-tap a window for civilians to pass.
* **Finisher:** slides to a knee, breath steady; a single line through rain—seam stitched, crowd flows.

**Damage Flavor:** when an Arcane Shot lands, thin wind-threads unfurl from the shaft, tugging rain into tidy arrows that point “safe way.”

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** cheerful, practical teasing, checks teammates’ breath rhythm after each volley.
* **Ideal:** “Accuracy is kindness.”
* **Bond:** keeps a silk knot from her instructor’s bowstring—rubs it before shots.
* **Flaw:** will attempt “thread-the-needle” shots for style when a simple pin would do.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, roof-rail parapets, lock-stair overlooks**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **overwatch escort**, **riot peel via pinning shots**, **apex duel at range**

---

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Harbor runner turned message archer; she learned to read wind over flooded quays. On Echo nights, she found that wind loved her arrows—and the city loved the lanes she stitched.

* **Lifestyle:** tidy loft with fletching bench and chalk strings on the wall.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, fletching side work.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

She measures victory by **how many people walk past smiling**—not by how many enemies fall.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** dead air where wind should guide (Echo-stilled spans).
* **Weaknesses:** **22 HP**, melee vulnerability if swarmed; Arcane Shot uses are limited.
* **Strengths:** **+8 longbow accuracy**, **Grasping/Seeking control**, **Action Surge** tempo.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**รุ่นเพื่อน — playful & supportive**

> “Hook your fingers on my back strap—yeah, there. If I say ‘thread,’ duck; if I say ‘pin,’ pass.”

เธอชอบยิ้มขำ ๆ แล้วแตะไหล่ให้จังหวะหายใจก่อนปล่อยศรถัดไป

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her wind-charms jingle only when a **forged rail** is near—then fall eerily silent on Severance spans.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Thread Map:** her bramble trails form arrows at midnight pointing to a sealed under-bridge.
  2. **Borrowed Fletch:** a gang copies her fletch pattern to fake Warden authority.
  3. **Falcon’s Debt:** an Auran spirit demands a favor—carry a message across a soundless storm.
