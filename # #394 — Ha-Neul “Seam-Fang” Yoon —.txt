## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Shock-Stop Senpai)

* **Role:** **frontline controller / aggro sink / emergency stopper**
* **Opener:** steps onto the seam, **Rage**; usually chooses **Tail** to spike AC on the first surge, then swaps in later fights to **Claws** for multi-hits or **Bite** for sustain.
* **Flow:** plants with **spear+tail** to absorb a charge, then transitions to **claw flurries** to carve a pass window; uses **Reckless** only when carving **now** matters more than safety.
* **Finisher:** two-hand spear thrust along the chalk seam; rain draws a clean pale line through her wake.

**Damage Flavor:** when claws extend, moon-silver glints along her glove caps; droplets skitter like tiny bats across the glass.

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** gentle voice, exacting corrections, praises breath rhythm; teasing when easing panic.
* **Ideal:** Stewardship — “Position is kindness. Pain is a down payment.”
* **Bond:** keeps a worn choir token from a night she held a bridge alone.
* **Flaw:** refuses to back off while anyone still crossing; takes risks to shield stragglers.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, lock-stairs, hush corridors**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **escort wall**, **riot peel by shock-stop**, **apex duel in rain**

---

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Night tally-clerk on the quays who learned where crowds *want* to flow. The first time Echo roared, she stepped forward, bared new claws, and the stampede forgot how to run.

* **Lifestyle:** spare loft with braided straps, drying boots, and tea that never quite cools.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, quiet gifts from shop rows she shields.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

She measures victory by **how quietly people breathe behind her**. A lane is a promise you keep with your body.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** a span where even her tail-parries don’t catch the rain (Severance stillness).
* **Weaknesses:** **AC 15**; focus fire hurts; must manage Reckless.
* **Strengths:** **mode-swapping** via Form of the Beast (AC spike / flurry / sustain), **Rage resistances**, precise lane control.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**รุ่นพี่ — calm & caring, lightly teasing**

> “Back strap—tighter. Two breaths with me. Eyes on the seam, not the neckline… good girl/boy.”

เธอแตะข้อมือให้จังหวะ ทำให้ใจนิ่งและก้าวตามได้โดยไม่รู้ตัว

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her braid-pin warms near **forged rails**, chills on **Severance-stilled** spans.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Seam-Fang Trial:** hold a choke alone through a full Echo rotation—rookies watching.
  2. **Counter-Claw:** a gang copies her glove caps; find their smith and the buyer.
  3. **Silent Echo:** a bridge refuses to reflect her tail parry—trace the anchor eating sound.
