## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Velvet Spear-Duelist)

* **Role:** **skirmisher / burst duelist / lane opener**
* **Opener:** coy smile → **Fighting Spirit** for advantage and temp HP → **1h spear** pokes with Dueling damage to claim aggro.
* **Flow:** rotates between **precise thrusts** and showy footwork to pull eyes off the crowd; **Action Surge** turns a safe hold into an immediate clear window.
* **Finisher:** pivot to two-handed stance and lunge; rain beads chase the haft in a single, clean line.

**Damage Flavor:** every advantage burst flings plum-tinted droplets that pop into tiny hearts before vanishing on the glass.

---

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** playful, shameless flirt; compliments footwork mid-fight to rattle foes.
* **Ideal:** Joy as Control — “If they look at me, they’re not hurting anyone else.”
* **Bond:** keeps a ribbon from the first fan who tossed flowers after a rescue.
* **Flaw:** loves applause; risks one extra flourish when he should just thrust.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, roof-rails, hush corridors**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **escort choke**, **duel for space**, **riot peel with spear fan-signals**

---

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Former theater extra; learned stage presence before steel. On his first Echo night, he stepped out to distract a charging brute—and discovered the crowd would follow his smile anywhere. The Wardens gave him a spear and a lane.

* **Lifestyle:** tiny garret with capes, powders, and folded fans.
* **Income:** city stipend, tips, private “lane-dance” lessons.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

He treats **charm as a shield** and **precision as mercy**. Scars are just signatures the rain forgets.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** dead-quiet spans (Echo devours applause); losing his nerve on a packed bridge.
* **Weaknesses:** **22 HP** and **AC 17** without a shield; needs tempo control.
* **Strengths:** **Fighting Spirit** advantage + temp HP, **Dueling** damage, **Action Surge** burst turns.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**Femboy — เย้ายวน:**

> “Hands on my waist… lower—mm, tactical, I swear. Now breathe with me and don’t look down… unless you want to.”

เขาชอบกระซิบใกล้หู ใช้คำสองแง่สามง่ามให้คนเสียอาการแล้วเดินตามจังหวะเขาอย่างว่าง่าย

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** his rose-gold lenses sometimes mist with **arrow-runes** pointing the safest thrust line.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Velvet Duel:** a rival samurai challenges his “improper” lane theatrics—public exhibition match.
  2. **Ribbon Debt:** the fan who gifted the ribbon is tied to a smuggling ring seeking his help.
  3. **Plum Mirage:** a Severance cell copies his outfit to mislead crowds; he must reclaim his “brand.”
