## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)**

“รุ่นพี่” tone — motherly tease with protective warmth. She smiles, taps your forehead gently:

> “Don’t rush into death. I’d rather not fix you again tonight.”
> If someone flirts, she meets it with amused calm:
> “Sweet words are like honey — best applied to wounds, not pride.”

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** Her divine glow is partially Resonant — not purely clerical. She hides that her magic draws from an ancient Echo crystal inside the Spire.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Echo of the Saint’s Pool:** Help Liora stabilize the crystal well that powers the Spire before it fractures.
  2. **The Broken Apprentice:** Recover her missing student, who joined the Severance cult to “heal the world by force.”
  3. **Mercy’s Edge:** Decide whether to support her controversial stance — arming healers for war.
