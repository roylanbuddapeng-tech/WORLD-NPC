## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Storm-Lane Sweeper)

* **Role:** **frontline controller / safe capture**
* **Opener:** coy wave → **Rage** flares as a hush of rain; **Storm Aura (Sea)** pops to **push** the loudest brute **off the safe line** without tossing them into civilians.
* **Flow:** **net** high-threat casters; trident taps ankles and guard-hands; uses **Reckless** only to draw aggro away from bystanders.
* **Finisher:** cheeky pirouette → trident lifts, **aura** crackles — foe slides back like the rain said “please move.”

**Damage Flavor:** hair buns halo with tiny lightning motes; droplets bead on his glasses, tracing heart shapes before falling.

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** innocent-flirty, playful helper; compliments first, swings later.
* **Ideal:** Care Through Chaos — “If I must be loud, let it be for someone’s safety.”
* **Bond:** keeps a pearl from his first rescue; kisses it before shifts.
* **Flaw:** too trusting; will try to “talk the monster down” mid-brawl.

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Busked as a street dancer; learned to read crowds and footwork before weapons. One night, a storm loved his rhythm — lightning purred when he spun. The Wardens taught him a trident and how to turn applause into **open lanes**.

* **Lifestyle:** tiny garret room; closet full of capes.
* **Income:** city stipend, performance tips after safe escorts.

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** sudden silences where rain should fall (Echo eats sound).
* **Weaknesses:** **AC 14**; hates tight quarters without a crowd to read.
* **Strengths:** **push aura control**, **Rage resistances**, **soft capture** with net.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**Femboy — ยั่วยวนใสซื่อ:**

> “Hold my cape, okay? If it flies up, it’s totally the storm’s fault… probably.”

ชอบแกล้งทำปากเบะแล้วส่งตาหวาน จากนั้นก็จับมือพาเดินในเลนปลอดภัย—ทำให้คนหน้าแดงจนลืมกลัว

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** when his aura hums, his glasses fog in runic shapes that **predict shove vectors**.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Pearl Forecast:** storms start tracing arrows on his lenses toward a hidden sea-door.
  2. **Net of Hearts:** a black-market ring sells cursed nets; Min has to swap them mid-riot.
  3. **Storm That Blushes:** a spirit claims Min “stole its rhythm” and wants a dance-duel at the bridge apex.
