## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Ribbon-Cut Escort)

* **Role:** **controller–skirmisher / burst window opener**
* **Opener:** shy smile → **Fighting Spirit** for advantage + temp HP, then a crisp **glaive tag** at reach to pin the bully off the seam.
* **Flow:** wheels to herd with the naginata’s **10-ft reach**; swaps to **shortspear** in tight rails. **Action Surge** turns a hold into a clean pass window on command.
* **Finisher:** spin-slice along the chalk seam; blue ribbons unfurl in the rain pointing *through*.

**Damage Flavor:** each advantaged strike flicks sky-blue droplets into a ribbon that lingers a heartbeat—just long enough for civilians to step.

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** earnest compliments, apologizes mid-feint (“s-sorry—coming through!”), quick to blush but steady under pressure.
* **Ideal:** **Kindness first, sharpness second.**
* **Bond:** keeps a child’s thank-you ribbon looped on his choker.
* **Flaw:** stays to reassure stragglers; needs firm calls to advance.

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Tea-runner for an amphitheater troupe; learned crowd physics from stage cues. On his first Echo night he lifted a ribbon to mark a safe line—the city followed, and he didn’t let go.

* **Lifestyle:** tidy garret over a tea stall; ribbon box, drying boots, neatly folded capes.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, grateful tips from shop rows.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

He counts success by **how calmly people move behind him**. Beauty is just a polite way to deliver safety.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** rails that won’t echo his ribbon (Severance stillness).
* **Weaknesses:** **24 HP**, no shield with glaive; can be focus-fired at reach.
* **Strengths:** **Fighting Spirit** burst (advantage + temp HP), **Action Surge** tempo, precise reach control, high crowd presence.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**Femboy — ใสซื่อ:**

> “C-could you hold my back strap? Tighter is… o-okay! When the ribbon lifts, we step—together.”

เขามักเผลอชมแบบไร้เดียงสา ทำคนข้าง ๆ หน้าแดงก่อนจะก้าวตามจังหวะได้พอดี

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** his bell-bangle rings faintly near **forged rails** and goes dead on **Severance-stilled** spans.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Blue Trail:** midnight ribbons in rain point to a sealed under-bridge.
  2. **Stage Thief:** a mimic performer copies his escort cues to steer crowds—unmask the fake.
  3. **Quiet Bow:** Fighting Spirit fizzles on one span; trace the anchor eating confidence.
