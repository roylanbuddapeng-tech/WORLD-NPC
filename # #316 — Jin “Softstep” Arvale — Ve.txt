**Damage Flavor:** when he drops someone, the air around him stills; his ribbon flutters once, then lies quiet.

## 💬 Personality

* **Flaw:** fascinated by near-death confessions; lingers too long in danger.
* **Quirk:** counts out-loud in a whisper (1–2–3) before strikes.

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — Mortuary Annex, glass canals, midnight cloisters**

---

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

A quiet apprentice who washed the dead at the Archive, Jin learned that the breath before the last word is the most honest. Monks of the Long Death taught him to respect endings—and to engineer them with mercy.

* **Lifestyle:** tiny cell room above the Annex; tatami mat, incense, ledger of names.
* **Income:** mortuary stipend, quiet protection contracts, vow offerings.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

Death is a threshold, not a terror. He delivers it without cruelty, and keeps promises the dying could not keep.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** a death with no breath—Severance-stolen endings.
* **Weaknesses:** thin HP; if swarmed without ki, fragile.
* **Strengths:** battlefield poise, reliable finisher sustain (**Touch of Death**), superb mobility.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**Femboy tone — silky, suggestive:**

> “Relax your jaw… mmh, good. Now let me steal just one more breath.”

เขาชอบทำให้เขินด้วยการจับข้อมือวางทาบหน้าอกตัวเองให้รู้สึกถึงจังหวะหัวใจ แล้วกระซิบใกล้หูว่า

> “There—now we’re in the same rhythm.”

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** his bone-needle was carved from a saint’s rib; whispers echo when it tastes blood.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Breath Tax:** an Echo that collects last breaths stalks the Annex—Jin’s ribbons start moving on their own.
  2. **Three-Count Duel:** a rival monk claims Jin cheats the count; a ritual duel decides whose mercy is true.
  3. **The Name He Won’t Write:** he refuses to record one name—his own, seen in a glass reflection during rites.
