## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Clinical Control & Cull)

* **Role:** **controller / finisher healer (via Grim Harvest)**
* **Opener:** tags a brute with **Cause Fear** to peel lines; slings **Web** to fix a cluster; plucks off the weakest with **Ray of Sickness** for **Grim Harvest**.
* **Flow:** keeps **Mage Armor** up; **Shield** on lethal swings. **Blindness/Deafness** removes threats like archers or chanters.
* **Finisher:** **Toll the Dead** on wounded targets; the bell’s after-ring maps arteries in the rain.

**Damage Flavor:** when he kills, rain draws faint anatomical lines over the corpse before fading, and his coat settles as if exhaling.

---

## 💬 Personality (สุดโต่ง)

* **Traits:** icily polite; takes notes while people scream; corrects grammar mid-threat.
* **Ideal (Extremist):** “Truth is worth any body-count.”
* **Bond:** his ledger of “failed subjects” is indexed by tone of last word.
* **Flaw:** compulsion to escalate experiments—refuses clean kills if a test is possible.

---

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes**—drainside morgues, hush corridors, rain-greased steps to under-bridges
* **Threat Gradient:** **Deep Echo** (he hunts where screams warp)
* **Encounter Framing:** **kidnap-rescue dissection raid**, **morgue siege**, **rain-duel on glass slabs**

---

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Dockside coroner who learned that Echo changes how tissue “sings.” He left the ledger open too long and realized bodies are just questions with warm ink.

* **Lifestyle:** immaculate cellar lab above a legal front; sleeps in a chair facing the slab.
* **Income:** corpse-transfer bribes, black-market “specimens,” quiet nobles’ retainers.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

Pain is a reagent; people are trials. He will spare a bystander only if it preserves a better data set.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** choirs that **fall silent**—no echo, no data (Severance stillness).
* **Weaknesses:** low HP, reliant on spell slots; hates fair fights.
* **Strengths:** layered control (**Web/Blindness/Fear**), **reactive defense (Shield)**, self-sustain via **Grim Harvest**.

---

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**How he toys with people:** speaks softly about your pulse cadence; asks to “borrow a scream”; compliments bone density like a love note.
**PCs making him flustered:** remain utterly calm; he starts over-explaining procedures until he slips.

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** keeps a **black ledger** of echo-modified organs; a few victims still whisper.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Ledger of Names:** rescue targets listed for “tonal isolation”—his lab moves nightly.
  2. **Quiet Bell:** he seeks a span where **Toll the Dead** makes no sound; stop him before he figures out why.
  3. **Buyer’s Hand:** a Severance broker wants his **silence-map**; tail the courier through rain.
