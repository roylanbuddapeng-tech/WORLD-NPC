* **Finisher:** Low feint → upward pact cut; curse shatters in a silent starburst.
* **Damage Flavor:** Force strikes leave thin comet tails that burn to embers.

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Former caravan guard turned relic-runner. After a Severance-tainted job nearly doomed a district, he bargained with the **Glareshade**—a sword-echo in the Nightward vaults—for power to make amends.

* **Lifestyle:** Spartan; sleeps little, journals case notes.
* **Income:** Order stipend + bounty shares.
* **Relationships:** Mutual respect with Taria Venloris; cautious ally to Lyss Fenvale.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

He weighs every strike against consequence. Mercy preferred; finality reserved for monsters and traitors.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** Losing control of the pact’s “temper.”
* **Weaknesses:** Overcommits to protecting civilians; susceptible to bait.
* **Strengths:** Versatile defense, reliable ranged pressure, decisive melee closer.

---

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

“วัยกลางคน” tone — grounded, mentoring, a touch teasing. He adjusts your grip with two fingers: “Relax the wrist. I’d like you to keep that hand.” If flustered, he clears his throat and studies the horizon as if judging weather.

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** His pact blade sometimes whispers names—future targets or those he’s spared. He hasn’t told the Order.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Names in the Steel:** Track why the blade speaks the name of a still-living ally.
  2. **Causeway Starfall:** Stabilize a star-echo breach before it births a sword-wraith.
  3. **Debt to the Nightward:** Choose whether Corin obeys an unjust Order writ.
