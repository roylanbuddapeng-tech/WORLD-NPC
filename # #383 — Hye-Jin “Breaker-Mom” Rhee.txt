## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Motherline Bulwark)

* **Role:** **frontline controller / aggro sink**
* **Opener:** **Reckless** reach-cut to tag the lead brute; she plants feet on the seam so civilians can flow past.
* **Flow:** triggers **Frenzy** only when a gap must be carved **now**; off-hand handaxe throws are for disrupting flanks, not chase.
* **Finisher:** hip-pivot half-moon sweep with halberd beak; rain sparks off the edge in a clear “pass-through” arc.

**Damage Flavor:** silver motes thread off the halberd with each hit; her ponytail bell gives a near-silent *tik* when the line is safe.

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** protective, deadpan humor, shameless about battlefield hugs to steady nerves.
* **Ideal:** Shelter — “Strength is the rent we pay for the breath behind us.”
* **Bond:** keeps a stitched ribbon from her child’s cloak wrapped around the grip.
* **Flaw:** will not disengage while anyone remains behind her on the seam.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, lock stairs, hush corridors**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **escort wall**, **riot peel**, **quiet duel in heavy rain**

---

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

A dock porter who out-lifted men twice her size, she learned to stack weight through hips and breath. On her first Echo night she stepped forward with bare hands—by dawn, the Wardens issued a halberd and a route in her name.

* **Lifestyle:** tidy riverside room; cooks huge stews for the squad.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, quiet donations from shop rows she shields.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

She judges victory by **how gently the crowd can keep walking**, not by how hard she hits.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** a span too wide for one promise; a silence where rain should speak.
* **Weaknesses:** **AC 15**; ranged focus fire hurts; **Frenzy** exhaustion tax.
* **Strengths:** **Rage resistances**, **reach control**, emergency **Frenzy** burst to open lanes.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**MILF — protective, softly teasing**

> “Hand on my back strap—tighter. Good. Eyes on the seam, not the neckline. I’ll make the space.”

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** the wolf-charm warms when **forged rails** are near; it goes cold on Severance-stilled spans.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Frenzy Debt:** a smuggler saved in her lane now offers “repayment” that risks her badge.
  2. **Motherline Trial:** hold a bridge through midnight rotations without yielding once.
  3. **Bell of Silence:** her ponytail bell stops ringing entirely—someone is eating the rain’s voice.
