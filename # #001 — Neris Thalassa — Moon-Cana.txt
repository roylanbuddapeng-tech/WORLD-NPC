## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Randomized)

* **Role:** **Skirmisher / Scout Support**
* **Range Preference:** **Ranged-first (20–80 ft)**, then darting melee opportunism
* **Tactics:** Opens in **Hide**, marks lanes, **Shortbow** with Sneak Attack; uses **Cunning Action** to break line-of-sight. On pressure, **Skirmisher** steps back, then repositions by rope routes.
* **Signature Opener:** Drops a grapnel line across a narrow canal, fires from a knee, vanishes behind a stairwell echo.
* **Finisher:** Kites a target into a **prepared crossfire** with allies; last shot is a whispered “homebound” that lands as the enemy turns.
* **Damage Flavor:** Arrow impacts leave a **thin teal ripple** on stone, like water remembering a wave.

* **Bond:** A little ring-bound map from her late mentor; she updates it lovingly.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

Shy-“รุ่นน้อง” energy—glances up, then beams. When flustered, she fiddles her fish clip and says, “Um… I can run ahead and mark the turns for you, okay?” She blushes if praised and tries to repay compliments with small, earnest favors (free route intel, extra arrows).

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** Her song-crystal pendant stores **a courier code** that can call off a rogue Ranger unit—knowledge she’s not supposed to have.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Echo on the Wire:** Deliver a sealed score across hostile canals while Echo surges mimic footsteps on bridges.
  2. **The Vanished Mentor:** Her old mentor’s map-ring points to a hidden canal stair no one admits exists.
  3. **Whistle for Home:** A festival turns to riot; guide civilians using whistle codes while ruffians hunt the courier.
