## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Hooks:**

  1. **Echo’s Bite Malfunction:** The weapon begins firing on its own at night.
  2. **Bounty Gone Silent:** His former squadmate reappears as an Echo construct.
  3. **The Seventh Chamber:** Unlocking his revolver’s final rune may destroy him—or the Severance cell tracking him.
