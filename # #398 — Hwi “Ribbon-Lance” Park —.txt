## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Ribbon Ride & Mark)

* **Role:** **frontline controller / mounted lane-opener**
* **Opener:** gentle smile → mounts the **glass-shod horse**, threads the choke, **marks** the lead brute with a lance tag; the brute now has **disadvantage** attacking civilians/allies near Hwi.
* **Flow:** wheels to keep the marked foe near his stirrup; if the brute hits someone else anyway, Hwi’s next turn adds the **Unwavering Mark** **bonus attack** with **advantage** and **+3** damage. **Action Surge** converts a hold into a clear pass.
* **Finisher:** dismount-hop → **spear+shield** two-handed thrust along the chalk seam; rain braids into a rosy ribbon arrow.

**Damage Flavor:** each lance impact sheds rose-gold droplets that twist into a fluttering ribbon pointing “through.”

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** sweetly earnest, apologizes mid-charge (“s-sorry—coming through!”), beams when praised.
* **Ideal:** **Care in Motion** — “A gentle hand can drive a hard line.”
* **Bond:** keeps a child’s thank-you ribbon tied to his choker.
* **Flaw:** lingers to reassure stragglers; needs firm calls to press on.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, lock-stair aprons, roof-rails wide enough for mounts**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **mounted escort**, **riot peel with lance marks**, **apex duel in rain**

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Stable hand turned messenger; he learned to set a horse’s rhythm to the city’s breath. On his first Echo night he tied a pink ribbon to his spear so a panicked crowd could **follow the color**—and it worked.

* **Lifestyle:** tiny loft above the stables; ribbon box, saddle soaps, neatly folded capes.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, grateful shop-row tips.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

He measures success by **how smoothly people float behind his mount**. Courtesy first, courage second—speed ties it all together.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** a span too narrow for a mount; rails that refuse to ring.
* **Weaknesses:** lance is awkward on foot (disadvantage at 5 ft); can be focus-fired when isolated.
* **Strengths:** **AC 19**, **mounted mobility**, **Unwavering Mark** control, **Action Surge** tempo, high crowd presence.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**Femboy — ใสซื่อ (innocent, still teasing by accident):**

> “Um—can you hold my back strap? Tighter is… o-okay! When the ribbon flutters, we run—together.”

เขาเผลอชมแบบไร้เดียงสา ทำคนข้าง ๆ หน้าแดง แล้วก้าวตามจังหวะได้พอดี

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** his bell-bangle rings softly near **forged rails** but goes dead on **Severance-stilled** spans.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Ribbon Trail:** rose-gold drips at midnight trace a route to a sealed under-bridge.
  2. **Borrowed Mount:** a smuggler uses a lookalike horse and ribbon to mislead crowds—unmask the fake.
  3. **Quiet Stirrup:** something dampens Unwavering Mark on one bridge; find the anchor eating the lane.
