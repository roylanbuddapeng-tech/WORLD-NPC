## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Runic Reach Anchor)

* **Role:** **frontline controller / safety stitcher**
* **Opener:** chalks a **seam line**, calls **Giant’s Might** to meet tall threats at eye level; first **Fire Rune** hit **restrains** the wedge-brute.
* **Flow:** uses **Cloud Rune** to **redirect** dangerous hits away from civilians; halberd tip herds foes off the safe lane, **Action Surge** to seal the gap.
* **Finisher:** calm half-step pivot; one precise sweep and a giant’s hum through the haft—rain follows the cut like thread.

**Damage Flavor:** runes glow jade-silver; droplets string along the halberd’s path, then snap like stitches completing.

---

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** serene mentor, crisp instructions, praises effort before results.
* **Ideal:** Stewardship — “Power is for holding space, not filling it.”
* **Bond:** keeps a chipped halberd lug from her teacher; uses it as a chalk weight.
* **Flaw:** will tank risk personally rather than assign it to juniors.

---

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, lock-stairs aprons, hush corridors**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **escort seam hold**, **riot peel by redirect**, **quiet duel in rainlight**

---

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Carver’s apprentice who etched flood marks on quay posts; she learned where water wants to go. When Echo nights began, she carved runes into steel instead—so crowds could pass where water says “safe.”

* **Lifestyle:** neat studio over a rail—racks of hafts and chalk strings.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, private lane-safety consults.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

She measures victory by **the quiet of the people behind her**, not the noise she makes in front.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** a strike she can’t redirect; a seam that won’t hold.
* **Weaknesses:** no shield while using halberd; vulnerable to focused ranged fire.
* **Strengths:** **runic control (Cloud/Fire)**, **Giant’s Might** reach pressure, **Action Surge** to seal breaks.

---

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**รุ่นพี่ — calm & caring**

> “Thumb here, along the seam. Breathe with me—two counts in, two out. Good. Now we hold.”

Touches lightly at the wrist to set grip; a half-smile steadies nerves embarrassingly fast.

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her jade pendant glows when a **false rail** is present—an old carver’s ward reacting to counterfeits.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Thread the False Span:** a counterfeit bridge siphons crowds into a trap; Dana must mark the real seam mid-riot.
  2. **Rune Debt:** the rune-smith who taught her **Fire Rune** is missing; only Cloud patterns remain in his shop.
  3. **Giant’s Whisper:** her Giant’s Might starts humming a **new rune** in rain—who’s trying to write through her?
