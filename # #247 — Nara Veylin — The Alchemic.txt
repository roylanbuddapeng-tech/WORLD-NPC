## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Support / Backline Chemist)

* **Role:** **Ranged Healer / Debuff Manager / Ally Buffer**
* **Opener:** *Aid* → distribute potions (*Healing*, *Resilience*, *Swiftness*).
* **Flow:** *Web* to trap frontline enemies; *Sanctuary* or *Cure Wounds* on allies in melee.
* **Finisher:** mix volatile elixirs → throw (flavor acid / smoke).
* **Field Trick:** break a luminous vial mid-fight — glowing mist grants **light + minor concealment** for allies.

**Flavor:** every bottle she breaks releases a chemical melody — the pitch determines its effect.
