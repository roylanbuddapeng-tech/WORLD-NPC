## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Promise Anchor / Crit Pressure)

* **Role:** **frontline defender / lane keeper**
* **Opener:** steps onto the seam, sets **shield**, tags the lead brute with **spear**; **Improved Critical** punishes overreach and forces respect.
* **Flow:** uses **trident** to hook ankles or lever bodies off the seam; **Action Surge** converts a calm hold into a decisive pass window.
* **Finisher:** two-handed spear thrust along the chalk line; rain pulls into a rose-gold arrow that says **go**.

**Damage Flavor:** every clean hit draws a thin rose-gold line in the rain that lingers for a heartbeat—just long enough for the crowd to step.

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** maternal warmth, crisp instructions, deadpan teasing to melt panic.
* **Ideal:** Shelter — “Position is kindness; I’ll pay the price.”
* **Bond:** carries a child’s ribbon in her bangle; kisses it before patrols.
* **Flaw:** refuses to disengage while anyone still crosses; takes extra hits to keep promises.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, lock-stairs, hush corridors**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **escort seam hold**, **riot peel with lever-control**, **apex duel in rain**

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Former quay medic and dock forewoman; she learned where weight lives and how to move it. On an Echo night, she stepped forward, smiled, and the stampede learned to breathe.

* **Lifestyle:** tidy room over a soup kitchen; big stews for rookies after shift.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, small donations from market rows she shields.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

She counts success in **quiet, steady footsteps**. Mercy is pressure applied with care.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** a span too wide for one promise; Severance-stilled rails where rain won’t answer.
* **Weaknesses:** damage modest without crits; ranged focus fire can peel her from the seam.
* **Strengths:** **AC 19**, **crit range 19–20**, **Action Surge** tempo, reliable spear+shield fundamentals, trident levers.

---

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**MILF — protective, softly teasing**

> “Hand on my back strap—tighter. Eyes on the seam, not the neckline. When I say ‘pass,’ you pass.”

เธอแตะข้อมือให้จังหวะหายใจจนใจนิ่ง แล้วบังตัวให้เองโดยไม่ลังเล

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her glasses fog in neat **breath bars** that predict shove timing; they go blank on Severance spans.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Heart on the Rail:** hold one seam through a full Echo rotation with two rookies in tow.
  2. **Counter-Lever:** a gang copies her trident hooks—find the smith and shut the ring.
  3. **Silent Arrow:** the rose-gold rain-line fails on one bridge; track the anchor eating sound.
