## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Lane Anchor / Bodyguard Spear)

* **Role:** **frontline controller / protector**
* **Opener:** **Reckless** reach cut to tag the priority threat → **Ancestral Protectors** forces it to focus her, shielding civilians/party.
* **Flow:** plants feet on the rail seam; pivots hips to herd foes with the glaive’s beak; throws a handaxe only to stop flanks, never to chase.
* **Finisher:** shoulder-in, half-moon sweep; when the tiger-lines wrap the enemy, allies pass safely.

**Damage Flavor:** amber stripes brighten; spectral whiskers skitter in rain like luminous threads guiding allies.

* **Traits:** warm, teasing, protective “หัวหน้าทีมสายกอด”; laughs softly after hard hits.
* **Ideal:** Shelter — “Strength is rent you pay for the people behind you.”
* **Bond:** keeps a bead from her grandmother’s prayer cord; speaks to it before patrols.
* **Flaw:** will **not** disengage if innocents are trapped; overextends.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, lock stairs, hush corridors**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **escort wall**, **riot peel with reach weapon**, **quiet duel under heavy rain**

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Former dock porter turned line-guardian. The first night she raged, the rain traced tiger whiskers down the rail and a crowd slipped past behind her untouched. The Wardens put a glaive in her hands and never looked back.

* **Lifestyle:** spartan, sleeps short, cooks big for the squad.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, small donations from saved shopkeepers.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

She weighs choices by **who breathes easier after**. If that means taking the worst hit, she smiles through the bruise.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** a span so wide even her ancestors can’t cover the distance.
* **Weaknesses:** modest AC; if kited by ranged fire, needs cover.
* **Strengths:** **aggro lock** via Ancestral Protectors, **reach control**, **Rage** resistances.

---

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**MILF — protective, softly teasing**

> “Behind me, sweetheart. Breathe. The rail listens to confidence.”

When allies blush, she grins and bumps shoulders: “Eyes on the line, not the neckline.”

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her beads warm near forged-echo forgeries — the ancestors “hiss” at false rails.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **The Whisker Map:** spectral whiskers start pointing to a hidden span beneath the city.
  2. **Debt of the Dock:** smugglers target the families she once carried crates with.
  3. **Ancestor’s Trial:** her tiger-spirit demands a night without retreat to sanctify a bridge.
