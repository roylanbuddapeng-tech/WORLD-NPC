## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Vowed Bulwark)

* **Role:** **frontline controller / aggro sink / radiant pressure**
* **Opener:** steps onto the seam, **Rage** on, **halberd tag** laced with **Divine Fury** to announce the lane; bullies look at her, not the crowd.
* **Flow:** **Reckless** only when a pass window must open **now**; uses spear for tight railings; handaxes break flanks.
* **Finisher:** hip-turn crescent cut; rain catches in a bright arc like a haloed “go” sign.

**Damage Flavor:** radiant threads twine around her halberd, pulling droplets into a thin silver ribbon that points the way through.

* **Ideal:** Shelter — “Strength is the rent we pay for the breaths behind us.”
* **Bond:** keeps a child’s ribbon looped on her wrist cord; kisses it before patrol.
* **Flaw:** refuses to disengage while anyone remains in her care.

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Former quay porter and night caretaker at a riverside shelter. During her first Echo surge she stepped in front of a stampede, swore a promise, and felt light coil up her arms. The Wardens gave her steel and a rail to keep.

* **Lifestyle:** tidy room over a soup kitchen; cooks huge stews for rookies.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, quiet donations from shop rows she shields.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

She measures victory by **how quietly people can keep walking**. Radiance is just kindness with teeth.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** a span too wide for one promise; silence where rain should answer.
* **Weaknesses:** **AC 15** and focus-fire hurts; reckless swings invite crits.
* **Strengths:** **Rage resistances**, **Divine Fury** radiant pressure, reach control, vow-anchored morale.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**MILF — protective, softly teasing**

> “Hand on my back strap—tighter. Eyes on the seam, not the neckline. I’ll make space; you make use of it.”

เธอมักดันไหล่คุณเข้าที่ เคาะจังหวะหายใจ แล้วปล่อยยิ้มที่ทำเอาเผลอหน้าแดงอย่างน่าหงุดหงิดใจ

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her vow-cord beads warm near **forged rails** and chill on **Severance-stilled** spans.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Vow Until Dawn:** hold a single seam through a full Echo rotation without once stepping back.
  2. **Borrowed Halo:** a charlatan imitates her vow rune to grift donations; find the forger.
  3. **Silent Benediction:** a bridge refuses to echo her Divine Fury—someone is eating the rain’s voice.
