## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Wake Runner / Lane Herder)

* **Role:** **skirmisher–protector / reach control**
* **Opener:** **Rage** → **bonus-action Dash** to thread the choke; quick spear tag to claim aggro and pull threats off the safe rail.
* **Flow:** **disadvantage on opportunity attacks** lets her buzz-saw through enemy lines, herding them sideways while allies and civilians pass.
* **Finisher:** short-hop pivot; two-handed thrust that makes rain **split like a wake** along the haft.

**Damage Flavor:** droplets stream off her spear in tidy lines; when she grins, water beads chase her boots like playful otters.

* **Bond:** carries the rusty fishhook of the dockhand who taught her to run wet planks.
* **Flaw:** will overextend to save stragglers; needs someone to call her back.

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

* **Lifestyle:** tiny quay loft, rack of drying straps and boots.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, dock tips.

She measures success by **the number of people who get to keep walking**. Every breath behind her is a vote of confidence.

* **Weaknesses:** **AC 14–15**, susceptible to focused ranged fire; light damage if not raging.
* **Strengths:** **Rage** resistances, **bonus-action Dash while raging**, **OA disadvantage on enemies**, superb lane-threading.

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her river-stone pendant warms near **counterfeit rails**—it “remembers” honest water.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Wake Map:** her chalk wakes form an arrow at midnight toward a sealed under-bridge.
  2. **Otter Debt:** smugglers she once outran send a “thank-you” crate with strings attached.
  3. **Silent Current:** Echo drains the bridge’s ripple—Yui must make a lane with no water signs.
