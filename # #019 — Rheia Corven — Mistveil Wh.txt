## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)**

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** Keeps an encoded lullaby containing a forbidden Echo frequency that can erase memory of sound itself.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **The Silent Song:** Escort Rheia to deliver the lullaby to the Council before Severance agents seize it.
  2. **Feathers in the Canal:** Someone is imitating her—literally wearing her discarded feathers as disguise.
  3. **The Hollow Choir:** Investigate why her entire Choir hums the same haunting note in their sleep.
