📜 Background & Lifestyle**

Background: Born in the Thunder District, trained as a street fighter before joining the Arena Consortium. Earned her title by defeating three Stormborn knights in one night.

💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)**

“Tomboy Type 2” — bold, brash, and direct. Leans in close to smirk after winning: “Still standing? Good — means I can hit you harder next time.” If someone flirts back, she flushes, snorts, and deflects with a challenge instead of a reply.

🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks**

Secret: Her lightning markings were born from an Echo incident — her power might not be entirely natural.

Hooks:

Arena of Echoes: Fight beside Rinna when a storm rift erupts mid-tournament.

The Azure Debt: A Severance agent bets her soul token against her freedom.

Lightning Lesson: Train under Rinna to learn her dual-style technique.
