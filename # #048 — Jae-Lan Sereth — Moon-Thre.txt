* **Finisher:** Feint with empty palm → dagger flick from sleeve; laughter spell to disable the last threat.
* **Damage Flavor:** Strikes leave a hairline glimmer, like a silver thread slicing air.

* **Flaw:** Won’t abandon a target if it endangers his found family; overcommits.
* **Quirk:** Measures hallway lengths by steps and breath counts; taps a 3-beat rhythm before picking locks.

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Raised in the underside of the Moon Bazaar, Jae-Lan learned that applause can hide screams. He bent his talents toward protecting performers and witnesses from predatory nobles and Echo cults.

* **Lifestyle:** Minimalist loft above a costume shop; practices sleight of hand with silk fans.
* **Income:** Network stipend + cut from “retrieved” ledgers and blackmail proofs (used to protect victims).
* **Relationships:** Professional camaraderie with Lyss Fenvale; wary respect for Eryndor Lethis’s illusions.

* **Weaknesses:** Low durability; risks too much for clean outcomes.
* **Strengths:** Elite stealth, surgical misdirection, precise control of space.

---

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

“เมะ” tone — easy authority with gentle edges. He adjusts your collar and murmurs, “Eyes up. Walk like you belong, and the door will agree.” When someone flirts, he smiles sidelong: “Focus… afterward, I’m all ears.”

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** Keeps an encrypted ledger of noble clients who buy “silence.” Destroying it could free many… or erase leverage.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Curtain Call Heist:** Steal a blackmail reliquary during a sold-out performance without stopping the show.
  2. **The Unheard Choir:** Guard his street-choir as their harmonies start drawing Echo wraiths.
  3. **Silver Thread Severed:** Track a traitor who stole his moon-thread line that can “stitch” short gaps in reality.
