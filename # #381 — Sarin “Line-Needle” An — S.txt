* **Finisher:** two-handed thrust along the chalk seam—rain beads align like a stitched thread.

**Damage Flavor:** droplets gather on her spear and leap off in tidy arcs when a maneuver lands.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**รุ่นเพื่อน — teasing, practical**

> “Back strap—yep, tighter. If I wobble, you tug once… hey, eyes on the seam, not the *bun*.”

เธอชอบยิ้มมุมปากแล้วเคาะโล่ให้จังหวะหายใจพร้อมกัน

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her horn-buds warm near **forged rails**—they “itch” at counterfeits.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Needle Map:** her chalk lines rearrange at midnight into a route under the city.
  2. **Borrowed Seam:** a rival squad copies her stitch-marks to frame her team.
  3. **Brace Debt:** the maneuver rune on her spear belongs to a missing tutor.
