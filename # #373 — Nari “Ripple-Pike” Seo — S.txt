## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Arcane Lane-Pin)

* **Role:** **frontline defender / reactive control**
* **Opener:** mark the choke with chalk → **Shield** spell ready to catch the first swing; **spear+shield** tag to hold aggro.
* **Flow:** turtle-step footwork; **Magic Missile** to punish kites; **Absorb Elements** to survive bursts; **Action Surge** for decisive shove/finish.
* **Finisher:** quick swap two-handed spear for a lane-pierce thrust that makes rain split like a curtain.

**Damage Flavor:** droplets bead into ripples along her spear path; when *Shield* pops, a thin water-lens flashes over the glass.

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** earnest, apologizes when she hits too hard; stubborn about keeping promises.
* **Ideal:** Care — “A steady lane is a kind of hug.”
* **Bond:** keeps a folded note from her captain: “Small isn’t weak.”
* **Flaw:** flusters easily; overcorrects posture when teased.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, roof-rails, lock stairs**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **escort pin**, **riot peel**, **quiet duel at a slick apex**

---

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

A dock-runner who learned balance chasing crates across wet planks. Her dolphin-blood made her read water like sheet music; the Court taught her to draw lanes with steel and spells.

* **Lifestyle:** tiny attic with drying racks for harness straps.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, grateful tips from shop rows she keeps safe.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

She measures victory by **how smoothly people pass behind her**, not by enemies fallen.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** **dead water** (Echo silences the rain); slipping when others trust her feet.
* **Weaknesses:** modest damage without Action Surge; can be baited by taunts.
* **Strengths:** **AC 19**, **on-demand Shield**, **bonded spear+shield**, **steady control in rain**.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**รุ่นน้อง — shy but flirty when flustered**

> “H-hold the strap here… i-it helps me balance… w-wait, not that strap!”

She blushes, then plants her spear with a tiny stomp: “A-anyway—stay behind me!”

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her glasses fog with **arrow-like runes** before danger—micro-currents whisper black-ice spots.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Ripple Map:** her chalk marks rearrange into a hidden route at midnight.
  2. **Dead Water Night:** Echo stills the rain; Nari must fight without her “water sense.”
  3. **Harness Heist:** smugglers want her runic support harness design.
