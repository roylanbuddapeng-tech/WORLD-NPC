## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Chaos-Control Pike)

* **Role:** **frontline skirmisher / lane shaper**
* **Opener:** **Rage** → let **Wild Surge** decide the first “star trail”; she steps where the sparks fall, drawing enemies away from civilians.
* **Flow:** **spear** for precision pin; swap to **glaive** when the span widens; uses **Reckless** selectively to pull aggro into her surge zone.
* **Finisher:** short-hop feint; star-motes pop along the spear line—**Action economy stays Barbarian**, effects are surge flavor per TCoE.

**Damage Flavor:** rain turns to glittering beads along her weapon; when a surge pops, the beads arc like a comet tail.

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** banter-happy, competitive grin, checks on teammates between swings.
* **Ideal:** Joy Under Pressure — “If I’m smiling, the crowd breathes.”
* **Bond:** keeps a folded rail ticket from the night she first saved a lane.
* **Flaw:** chases “cool” plays; will attempt a stylish pivot instead of a safer shove.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, roof-rails, lock stairs**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **riot peel via surge zones**, **escort choke**, **duel on a slick apex**

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

A courier who sprinted wet planks for tips; when Echo night hit, she grabbed a forgotten spear and found the storm tracing her steps with light. The Wardens taught her to steer chaos instead of fear it.

* **Lifestyle:** tiny loft with star maps and grip tape.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, courier side-gigs.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

She judges success by **how smoothly people pass behind her**, not by the bruises she collects.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** a “dead sky” surge that refuses to light; Echo eating her starlight.
* **Weaknesses:** **AC 14–15**, vulnerable to focus fire; Wild Surge unpredictability can misalign plans.
* **Strengths:** **Rage resistances**, **on-hit pressure with spear/glaive**, **surge utility** to herd or burst.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**รุ่นเพื่อน — playful, supportive**

> “Okay, your hand on my strap—no, the *back* strap. Ready? We pivot on three—smile.”

เธอชอบแหย่ให้คนข้าง ๆ ยิ้มก่อนเริ่มวิ่งเสมอ ทำเอาเผลอหน้าแดงแล้วก้าวได้พอดีจังหวะ

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her bell charm tings only when a **favorable** surge is coming—she thinks it’s luck; it’s actually keyed to an old starmage ward.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Comet Rail:** surges sketch a route to a sealed bridge; the map appears only in rain.
  2. **Ticket to Silence:** her keepsake ticket belongs to a vanished courier cult.
  3. **Borrowed Constellation:** a rival steals her bell; surges turn hostile until it’s reclaimed.
