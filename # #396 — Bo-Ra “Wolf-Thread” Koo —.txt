## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Pack-Caller Controller)

* **Role:** **frontline controller / ally enabler**
* **Opener:** **Rage**, step to the choke, spear-tap the loudest brute; announces “**Pack!**” so allies dive in with **advantage** from Wolf totem.
* **Flow:** plants **shield** to keep the seam clean; throws a **handaxe** to clip flanks; uses **Reckless** only to yank eyes off civilians.
* **Finisher:** pivot into a two-handed thrust; rain draws a tidy arrow behind her as the line passes.

**Damage Flavor:** fox-gold motes gather at her boots; droplets align like pawprints pointing “safe way.”

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** cheeky, encouraging, counts breaths for the squad; laughs once to break tension.
* **Ideal:** “We move as one.”
* **Bond:** keeps a stitched ribbon from her first saved shop row.
* **Flaw:** chases the stylish shove when the boring hold would do.

* **Lifestyle:** cozy loft of straps, chalk strings, fox-charms, and drying boots.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, alley-drill side gigs.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

Victory = **more footsteps behind her than ahead**. Pride is for after the bridge.

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** a span where voices won’t sync (Severance stillness).
* **Weaknesses:** resource-gated (**Rage 3/LR**), ranged focus fire.
* **Strengths:** **ally advantage aura (Wolf)**, **Rage resistances**, **shielded line**, simple reliable kit.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**รุ่นเพื่อน — teasing & supportive**

> “Back strap—yep, tighter. When I say ‘Pack,’ you pounce. I’ll nip first.”

เธอเคาะโล่ให้จังหวะ ทำคนข้าง ๆ ยิ้มหลุด ก่อนทั้งหมดจะพุ่งพร้อมกันอย่างพอดี

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her fox-charm warms near **forged rails** and chills on **Severance-stilled** spans.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Borrowed Howl:** a gang copies her call-signals—reclaim the pack code.
  2. **Night Prints:** fox-gold pawprints appear at midnight, pointing to a sealed under-bridge.
  3. **Quiet Pack:** her call falls flat on one span; someone is eating the rhythm.
