## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Radiant Spear-Dancer)

* **Role:** **skirmisher / aggro-tempo spark**
* **Opener:** coy smile → **Rage** surges; **whip** tugs a sleeve or weapon-hand to open the seam; **spear** darts in to **proc Divine Fury** radiant pop.
* **Flow:** **Reckless** only to steal aggro off civilians; dances sideways along rail seams, teasing steps to bait swings into slick footing.
* **Finisher:** spear feint low → heel pivot → radiant thrust; rain scatters like gold dust.

**Damage Flavor:** tiny sunbursts bead on the spearhead each time he giggles—then burst on impact like warm sparks.

* **Ideal:** Joy as Tactic — “If they look at me, they’re not looking at the crowd.”
* **Bond:** a sun-charm from a healer who once revived him; he kisses it before patrols.
* **Flaw:** plays to the crowd; risks one extra spin for applause.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**Femboy (เย้ายวน):**

> “Grip my waist when I spin—purely tactical… unless you’re blushing.”

เขาชอบกระซิบใกล้หู แล้วลากนิ้วที่หลังมือให้คนโฟกัสกับจังหวะก้าว—หัวใจคนดูเต้นตามเขาแทนจะเต้นตามความกลัว

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** the sun-charm glows when he’s about to land a lethal thrust—if it dims, someone nearby is lying about their wounds.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Blush on the Bridge:** a cult tries to bait his showmanship; PCs must keep him from overcommitting.
  2. **Foxlight Debt:** a revival miracle demands a favor—escort a relic across a silent span.
  3. **Whip of Vows:** his whip once bound a vow between lovers; it now tugs disarmed blades like “broken promises.”
