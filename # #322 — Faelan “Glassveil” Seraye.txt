## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** one of his mirrors shows future applause—without him on stage.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **The Vanishing Noble:** his decoy job leaves a real noble missing; illusions may have grown teeth.
  2. **Silver Dust:** Echo zones start copying his **Silent Image** constructs.
  3. **Kiss of Glass:** a cursed admirer’s kiss turns his duplicates tangible—briefly murderous.
