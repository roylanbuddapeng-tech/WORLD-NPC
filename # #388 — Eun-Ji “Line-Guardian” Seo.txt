## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Ancestral Pin & Pass)

* **Role:** **frontline defender / aggro anchor**
* **Opener:** **Rage** + precise **spear tag** to brand the lead brute with **Ancestral Protectors**, forcing it to focus on her while the crowd slips by.
* **Flow:** maintains seam with **shield** angles; uses **Reckless** only to snag attention off civilians; handaxe flicks disrupt flanks.
* **Finisher:** step-in feint → two-handed thrust; spirit-rings flare and the rain stitches a path right past her.

**Damage Flavor:** translucent red-panda silhouettes swirl at her shoulders when she hits, padding blows and nudging enemies off the seam.

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** teasing-in-a-nice-way, checks teammates’ breathing, cheers when anyone nails footwork.
* **Ideal:** “Protection is a conversation—me, you, and the ancestors.”
* **Bond:** keeps a woven knot from her grandmother; taps it before stepping onto the rail.
* **Flaw:** refuses to drop aggro even when retreat would be smarter.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, roof-rails, lock stairs**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **escort choke**, **riot peel with spirit mark**, **apex duel in rain**

---

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Granddaughter of a knot-weaver; learned to read tension and load through ropes before steel. The first time Echo hit, she tied people together with **breaths**, not rope—and the spirits answered.

* **Lifestyle:** tiny loft of straps, knots, and a tea kettle that never quite cools.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, “knot lessons” for rookies.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

Victory = **the quiet behind her**. Pain is acceptable; panic is not.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** a span where the ancestor-rings go silent (Severance).
* **Weaknesses:** **AC 15**; focus fire hurts; must manage Reckless usage.
* **Strengths:** **team-wide protection via Ancestral Protectors**, **Rage resistances**, reliable **spear+shield control**.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**รุ่นเพื่อน — teasing & supportive**

> “Back strap—yep, tighter. If the voices swirl, that means I’ve got their eyes. You just pass.”

เธอชอบเคาะโล่เบา ๆ ให้จังหวะหายใจ แล้วเอียงหัวยิ้มจนคนข้าง ๆ เผลอหน้าแดง

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her glasses fog in braided patterns that **predict shove vectors** for one heartbeat.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Knot Map:** ancestor knots form a route to a sealed under-bridge at midnight.
  2. **Borrowed Grandmother:** a spirit claiming to be her gran orders her to protect a stranger—why?
  3. **Quiet Rings:** the rings stop answering on one bridge; someone has **cut** them.
