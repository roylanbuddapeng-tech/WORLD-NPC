## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Echo Pin & Pass)

* **Role:** **frontline defender / decoy shifter**
* **Opener:** **Manifest Echo** on the far side of the choke to “hold space,” then tag the brute with a spear from either body; civilians flow through the gap.
* **Flow:** uses **Unleash Incarnation** for tempo pops; **swap** with echo to escape flanks or plug sudden leaks; **Action Surge** converts a safe hold into a quick shove-and-secure window.
* **Finisher:** echo draws aggro with a shield feint; real Mina lunges two-handed along the chalk seam—rain splits like mirrored glass.

**Damage Flavor:** every echo hit sheds a silver ring on the bridge that vanishes as the crowd passes.

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** upbeat, practical teasing, checks on teammates’ breath rhythm.
* **Ideal:** “Make room, make calm.”
* **Bond:** tiny mirror-charm from her kid sister—she taps it twice before patrols.
* **Flaw:** chases clever echo swaps even when a boring hold would do.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, roof-rails, lock-stairs**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **escort seam hold**, **riot peel by echo**, **apex duel in rain**

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Former street courier; learned to pass crowds by becoming their rhythm. On Echo nights she found a second rhythm—her own silhouette stepping where she could not. The Wardens called it a **useful miracle** and gave her a rail.

* **Lifestyle:** tiny loft with boot racks, chalk strings, and mirror shards for drills.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, courier side runs.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

She measures success by **how smoothly people pass behind her**, not the tally in front.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** a silent span that refuses to reflect (Echo eats the sound).
* **Weaknesses:** split-focus mistakes if she swaps too fancy; modest damage without Action Surge.
* **Strengths:** **AC 19**, **zone control via echo**, **extra attacks** with Unleash Incarnation, excellent **lane geometry**.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**รุ่นเพื่อน — teasing & supportive**

> “Back strap—yeah, tighter. If I vanish, I’m the other me. Don’t panic; just follow the seam.”

เธอชอบเคาะโล่ให้จังหวะหายใจพร้อมกัน ทำให้คนข้าง ๆ เผลอยิ้มแล้วเดินตามได้พอดี

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** rare nights, her echo reflects **someone else’s** stance—an old Warden’s ghost?
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Mirror Span:** echoes linger as footprints toward a sealed under-bridge.
  2. **Borrowed Shadow:** a thief learns to fake her echo flicker to bypass guards.
  3. **Double Bind:** Echo mimics an attack Mina never learned—who’s teaching through the rain?
