## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Ward-Spear Anchor)

* **Role:** **frontline defender / reactive tank / micro-buffer**
* **Opener:** chalks a seam, steps forward **spear+shield**; on the first heavy swing incoming, snaps **Shield** for +5 AC to hold the lane.
* **Flow:** **Green-Flame Blade** for controlled cleaves when foes cluster; **Absorb Elements** to tame burst damage and empower the next strike; **Action Surge** opens a pass window on command.
* **Finisher:** two-handed thrust along the chalk seam; jade sparks stitch the rain into a clean “go” arrow.

**Damage Flavor:** ward sigils glow jade-silver; every parry leaves a thin hex pattern in falling droplets.

---

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** patient, precise instructions; praises breathing rhythm and footwork.
* **Ideal:** Stewardship — “Discipline is just careful kindness.”
* **Bond:** keeps a chipped ward-plate from her mentor; taps it before castings.
* **Flaw:** overprotective; will stay planted too long to shield rookies.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, lock-stair aprons, hush corridors**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **escort seam hold**, **riot peel with wards**, **apex duel in rain**

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

A dock-ward scribe who etched flood marks on quay posts; she learned where water wants to go. When Echo nights came, she put sigils on steel, not slate—and found the city would stand still if she did.

* **Lifestyle:** tidy loft of rune-plates, chalk strings, and folded capes.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, private ward lessons.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

Success is **quiet behind her**. Magic is a promise, not a flourish.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** a span where wards won’t “take” (Severance static).
* **Weaknesses:** spell DC modest (**11**); limited slots—must time *Shield/Absorb Elements*.
* **Strengths:** **AC 19**, **reactive defenses**, **Action Surge** tempo, **weapon bond** security.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**รุ่นพี่ — calm, caring, faintly teasing**

> “Back strap—tighter. Two breaths with me… and eyes on the seam, not the neckline.”

เธอแตะข้อมือคุณให้จังหวะ ทำให้เงียบใจและก้าวตามได้พอดี

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her jade pendant warms near **forged rails**, chills near **Severance-stilled** spans.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Hex Stitch:** a counterfeit ward pattern spreads through the bridges; she must unpick it mid-riot.
  2. **Borrowed Plate:** her mentor’s broken plate whispers a **new glyph** in the rain.
  3. **Hold to Dawn:** maintain a single seam through an entire Echo surge rotation.
