## 🎯 Combat Tactics

* **Role:** **Support Controller / Mobile Healer**
* **Tactics:** Opens with *Faerie Fire* or *Entangle* to set the board; pops **Starry Form (Chalice)** to boost healing or **Archer** for reliable radiant chip. *Moonbeam* punishes shapechangers and holds lanes.
* **Signature Opener:** Tosses phosphor dust—constellations bloom underfoot; allies move like notes on a staff.
* **Finisher:** Starry Form (Archer) rapid volleys while *Moonbeam* corrals fleeing foes.
* **Damage Flavor:** Hits leave tiny star-ripples across water, fading like skipped stones.

* **Bond:** Keeps tide-letters from rescued sailors in her journal.
* **Flaw:** Chases data in dangerous conditions; underestimates her limits.
* **Quirk:** Names storms after friends; sketches constellations on mugs.

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Archivist parents; boat-child at heart. She engineered a star-map that overlays current vectors with celestial arcs, letting her predict Echo surges along canals.

* **Lifestyle:** Early runs, late notes; coffee with sea salt.
* **Income:** Archive stipend + hazard pay for Echo charting.
* **Relationships:** Friendly banter with Liora Fenvale; field-collabs with Lyra Thalassara; science-crush on Orin Kaelis’s lightning notes.

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

Truth should be useful and kind. If it can’t be both, make it kinder.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** Being caught in a “silent tide” (total Echo dampening) at sea.
* **Weaknesses:** Low raw damage if control fails; gets seasick after teleportation.
* **Strengths:** Superb battlefield shaping, reliable radiant output (Archer), clutch healing (Chalice).

---

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

“รุ่นเพื่อน” tone — breezy, conspiratorial, a little competitive.
She bumps shoulders: “Race you to the next lock gate—loser buys tea.”
If someone flirts, she grins: “Careful. I chart currents. Yours are… fast.”

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** Her star map sometimes draws constellations that don’t exist—future routes? or Severance lures.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **The Nonexistent Constellation:** Follow a phantom star-route that appears only on Yuna’s map.
  2. **Silent Tide Alarm:** Guard her while she plants resonance buoys before an Echo blackout.
  3. **Moonbeam Heist:** Use her *Pass without Trace* and canal charts to infiltrate a Severance barge.

## 💞 Interaction Preferences (Quick)

Likes **making others blush** with sudden competence: catching someone mid-stumble with a wink—“Tide’s with you.” She blushes if praised for her maps, then deflects with a dare.
