## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Spark-Herd Skirmisher)

* **Role:** **frontline skirmisher / soft control**
* **Opener:** shy smile → **Rage**; steps to the choke and taps the lead brute with **Storm Aura (Sea)** lightning as a **bonus action**; spear tag to pin the lane.
* **Flow:** dances just inside **10 ft aura**, zapping one target per turn to discourage rushers; uses **Reckless** only to drag eyes off civilians; converts a safe hold into a burst with quick two-handed thrust.
* **Finisher:** heel pivot, spear lunge; rain splits, and a blue ring pops where the lightning kisses the haft.

**Damage Flavor:** aura crackles in soft pearl-blue arcs around his thighs and boots, leaving tiny strobing ripples on wet glass.

---

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** gentle, apologizes mid-fight (“s-sorry, little zap!”), earnest praise for teammates.
* **Ideal:** Comfort as Tactic — “If they smile at me, they stop looking at fear.”
* **Bond:** keeps a folded note from a rescued choir kid: “You’re brave like rain.”
* **Flaw:** lingers to reassure stragglers; needs someone to call him forward.

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Canal messenger who practiced rail-balancing with tea trays; during an Echo surge he hugged a panicked child and felt the storm purr to protect them. The Wardens handed him a spear and told him to keep being “that smile.”

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**Femboy — ใสซื่อ (innocent, still flirty by accident):**

เขาชอบเผลอชมแบบไร้เดียงสา ทำคนข้าง ๆ หน้าแดงแล้วก้าวตามจังหวะได้พอดี

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** his shell-pendant tingles before **counterfeit rails**—the aura static crawls toward fakes.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Blue Wake:** his aura rings leave a midnight map to a sealed under-canal.
  2. **Storm Debt:** a sea-spirit wants repayment—escort a song-stone across a silent span.
  3. **Quiet Spark:** someone is siphoning his lightning into traps; trace the stolen charge.
