## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)**

“รุ่นพี่” tone — mature confidence, teasing kindness.

> “You swing with heart, but not with breath. Relax, before I have to show you again.”
> If someone flirts:
> “Careful… compliments can be blinding when reflected off armor.”

When *she’s* caught off guard, she looks away, smoothing her cloak unnecessarily:

> “Don’t mistake a pause for weakness.”

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** Carries a relic containing her fallen rival’s soul—her mercy cost her promotion.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Ashes of Mercy:** Help her cleanse the relic before it corrupts her.
  2. **The Silver Duel:** A rival knight challenges her honor in secret.
  3. **Oath at Dusk:** Her divine power flickers; something is dimming her faith.
