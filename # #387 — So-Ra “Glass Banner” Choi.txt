## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Command Anchor / Rally Line)

* **Role:** **frontline defender / party buffer / aggro keeper**
* **Opener:** sets **chalk seam**, steps in with **spear+shield**, claims aggro on the loudest brute; calls cadence for civilians.
* **Flow:** when allies wobble, triggers **Rallying Cry** (Second Wind) to **heal the team at range** while staying planted; **Action Surge** converts a safe hold into a decisive pass window.
* **Finisher:** dismount pivot into a two-handed thrust along the seam; rain beads line the haft like stitched jade thread.

**Damage Flavor:** each ordered thrust pulls rain into tidy arrows pointing “through,” while her bangle beads chime once when the lane is safe.

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** patient teacher, crisp commands, praises effort before results.
* **Ideal:** Stewardship — “Position is kindness; discipline is how it shows.”
* **Bond:** keeps her mentor’s broken whistle on the bangle; touches it before every shift.
* **Flaw:** shoulders blame for any slip; refuses to fall back while someone still crosses.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, lock-stair aprons, hush corridors**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **escort seam hold**, **riot peel with rally**, **apex duel in rain**

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Former drill assistant at the rider stables; learned cadence before combat. On her first Echo night, she didn’t charge—she **counted breaths** and made a lane with orders that felt like a lullaby. The Wardens made her a captain the next week.

* **Lifestyle:** spare captain’s loft with charts, chalk strings, and neatly folded capes.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, private formation clinics.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

She measures victory by **how quietly people pass behind her**, not how loudly foes fall.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** a silence where rain won’t answer cadence.
* **Weaknesses:** damage is modest without Action Surge; can be focused by ranged fire.
* **Strengths:** **AC 19**, **Rally healing at range**, **Action Surge** tempo, **reliable spear+shield control**.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**รุ่นพี่ — calm, caring, faintly teasing**

> “Back strap—tighter. Good. Now two breaths with me… and eyes on the seam, not the neckline.”

เธอชอบแตะข้อมือคุณให้จังหวะ ทำให้ใจนิ่งและก้าวทันโดยไม่รู้ตัว

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her jade pendant warms near **forged rails** and chills on **Severance-stilled** spans.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Banner Under Fire:** hold a bridge while training two rookies—success unlocks a new route.
  2. **Whistle Debt:** her mentor’s lost whistle appears engraved with a **counter-cadence**.
  3. **Silent Parade:** an enemy plans a “quiet march” to nullify Rallying Cry; break the silence.
