> “Flattery heals nothing, dear. But do continue — it’s pleasant.”

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** Her shrine stands over a sealed Echo fissure; her healing rites suppress it unknowingly.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **The Whisper Beneath the Shrine:** Investigate why prayers now echo back with voices of the dead.
  2. **Moonlight Cure:** Escort her to collect an extinct herb growing only in Echo storms.
  3. **The One She Couldn’t Save:** A ghost from her past returns — healed, but wrong.
