## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Chaos Thread Skirmisher)

* **Role:** **skirmisher / soft control via Wild Surge**
* **Opener:** **Rage** → Wild Surge flares (e.g., **spectral vines** to hinder rushers or **gust motes** to shove), then a dart-in spear tag to claim the seam.
* **Flow:** dances between foes, using **Reckless** only to pull eyes off civilians; throws a **handaxe** to pop flanks; **Magic Awareness** pings illusions before escorting crowds.
* **Finisher:** quick two-handed thrust as motes whirl; rain threads into a neat spiral arrow pointing “through.”

**Damage Flavor:** emerald motes buzz from her boots; each step leaves a tiny ripple-ring that fades when allies pass.

## 💬 Personality

* **Ideal:** Help First — “If I’m fast, fear has less time to grow.”
* **Bond:** carries a stitched ribbon from a dock singer she guided through a surge.
* **Flaw:** overextends to rescue stragglers; needs someone to call her back.

* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, dockside tips.

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her wind-charm hums a **counter-melody** when a rail is counterfeit.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Buzz Map:** her surge motes spiral into an arrow at midnight toward a sealed under-bridge.
  2. **Borrowed Song:** a chorus claims her motes “remember” a lost conductor—help them find the score.
  3. **Quiet Spiral:** Wild Surge effects go mute on one span—trace the Severance anchor.
