* **Secret:** One Chalice contract forged his name on a kill-list—his own. Someone inside wants him silenced.
* **Hooks:**

  2. **Venom Ledger:** Retrieve the stolen ledger mapping Warrens’ Echo pores before Severance agents mutate its formulas.
  3. **Chalice Within:** Decide whether to expose a traitor inside the Black Chalice or let Sethir fake his death.
