## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**เฟมบอย tone — designed to fluster.**
He leans in close, lashes low, voice a purr:

> “You’re staring, handsome. Want a private chorus or just the encore?”
> He **targets men shamelessly**: brushes fingers at the collar, whispers double entendres, lets the **underbust** line do the rest.
> If someone flips the script, he laughs breathlessly:
> “Mmh—dangerous. Keep talking like that and I’ll miss my cue.”

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** Knows the **master pass-song** for Cabaret safehouses; a rival troupe wants it.

  2. **Foxglass Mask:** Retrieve his stolen glamoured mask before a Severance broker copies his voiceprint.
  3. **Encore of Silence:** Someone curses his bell anklet to mute him mid-show — find the hexer before the big festival.
