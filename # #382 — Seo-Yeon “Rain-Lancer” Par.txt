## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Mounted Line Anchor)

* **Role:** **frontline defender / aggro keeper / escort pivot**
* **Opener:** mounts fast; **mark** the lead brute with a set spear to pin aggro; positions **Miststep** to block the seam with shield angle guiding civilians.
* **Flow:** alternates **lance passes** with **shield holds**; uses **Action Surge** to convert a safe hold into a decisive push window.
* **Finisher:** dismount pivot → two-handed spear thrust; rain springs off the haft in a fan that reads “pass now.”

**Damage Flavor:** each hit throws a thin spray like stitched rain; her glasses flash a silver line just before the thrust lands.

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** patient teacher, soft-spoken, exacting about safety rules.
* **Ideal:** Stewardship — “Position is kindness.”
* **Bond:** keeps a braid from her first mount tied to her wrist strap.
* **Flaw:** takes responsibility for every slip; will not retreat if anyone’s still crossing.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, roof-rails, lock-stair aprons**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **mounted escort**, **riot peel at a choke**, **apex duel in rain**

---

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Stablehand to instructor: she learned hoof-sense before spear-sense. On her first Echo night, she rode a borrowed mare into a crush, split it clean, and never left the saddle again.

* **Lifestyle:** sparse rider’s loft over the stables; up before dawn.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, private riding lessons.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

Success is when **the line behind her breathes easier**. Discipline is just compassion with muscles.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** losing a rider under her command; a silent span where hooves can’t trust the rain.
* **Weaknesses:** tight indoor spaces limit mount advantage; vulnerable to concentrated ranged fire.
* **Strengths:** **mark-based aggro control**, **mount synergy**, **high AC**, **formation tutoring**.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**รุ่นพี่ — calm & caring**

> “Thumb along the rein… breathe. Good. Now match my heel cue—on *three*.”

เธอแตะหลังมือคุณเบา ๆ ให้จังหวะ แล้วปล่อยยิ้มบาง ๆ ที่ทำเอาเผลอหน้าแดงได้ง่าย

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her wrist rain-charm warms near **counterfeit rails** and turns cold near **Severance-stilled** spans.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Spur in the Silence:** mounts refuse a certain bridge; Seo-Yeon must test the seam under fire.
  2. **Borrowed Mare:** the former owner of *Miststep* returns with a dubious claim.
  3. **Glass Tactics:** a rival officer challenges her methods—trial by public escort.
