“รุ่นน้อง” tone — quiet and polite; peeks up shyly when praised. She fidgets with her choker chain and whispers, “I’ll try harder next time, promise.” If someone flusters her, she hides behind a mission excuse. Tries to mimic her seniors’ poise but always ends up blushing mid-sentence.

  2. **The Silent Bloom:** A Severance agent impersonates her twin reflection; find the real Eira.
  3. **Echo in the Hollow:** Stop a ritual that turns song into literal silence.
