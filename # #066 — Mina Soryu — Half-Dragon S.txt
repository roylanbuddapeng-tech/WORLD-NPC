## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Born from a liaison between a Thalassaran court mage and a draconic emissary. Studied resonance harmonics until she outpaced her professors. Rumor says she caused the “Storm of Glass” incident at age 19 — though she smiles and never denies it.

* **Lifestyle:** Luxurious minimalism — silk sheets, tea rituals, midnight studying.
* **Income:** Academy salary, private tutoring, resonance consultancy.
* **Relationships:** Mentor to Riko Hanamura; ex-partner (and friendly rival) of Kaoru Veylan; trusted peer to Lyra Thalassara.

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

Power means stewardship. She protects others from the storm — even if she *is* the storm.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** Losing control of her draconic surge mid-storm.
* **Weaknesses:** Overconfidence; reliant on line of sight.
* **Strengths:** Rapid reaction, control spells, battlefield poise.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)**

“รุ่นพี่” tone — confident warmth, half-flirt half-advice.

> “Relax, sweetling. You’re shaking because the air’s charged… or is it me?”
> When teased back:
> “Bold! I like that—keep your spark alive.”
> She enjoys **making others blush** deliberately, lightly brushing fingers when handing spell components.

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** Her lightning occasionally sings in resonance with Severance frequencies — she suspects her draconic blood ties to something older.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Echo of the Blue Lineage:** Investigate her ancestral vault where lightning hums like music.
  2. **Storm of Glass Redux:** A Severance agent replicates her past experiment; she must face the echo of herself.
  3. **Azure Pact:** Aid Mina in stabilizing her dragon blood before it destabilizes the Academy’s wards.

## 💞 Interaction Preferences (Quick)**

She flirts by proximity — stands close, voice low:

> “Don’t flinch. Lightning only bites if you *ignore* it.”
> If someone compliments her power, she laughs softly:
> “Careful. I might start showing off for you.”
