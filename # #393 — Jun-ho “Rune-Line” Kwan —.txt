## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Rune Redirector / Lane Opener)

* **Role:** **controller–skirmisher / aggro misdirection**
* **Opener:** coy smile → **Giant’s Might** to “loom” without losing grace; **Cloud Rune** ready to **redirect** the first dangerous hit into a thug blocking the seam.
* **Flow:** plays at reach with **glaive**; uses **Stone Rune** to charm a charger for a breath-count, turning a riot into choreography; **Action Surge** when a clean pass window appears.
* **Finisher:** spin-slice along the chalk seam; bronze runes flare and the rain threads into an arrow that says **go**.

**Damage Flavor:** bronze sigils blink in sequence down the haft; droplets bead into tiny runic letters that evaporate as crowds slip past.

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** flirtatious, theatrical, wickedly encouraging under pressure.
* **Ideal:** **Spectacle as Shield** — “If they’re staring at me, they’re not hurting anyone.”
* **Bond:** keeps a bronze rune-disc from his mother’s forge; kisses it before patrol.
* **Flaw:** loves showy redirects; risks a flourish when a plain block would work.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, roof-rails, hush corridors**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **escort choke with redirects**, **riot peel via charm**, **duel in rainlight**

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Born over a Skarnov anvilstage; he learned that lines—of steel or people—move where you mark them. On his first Echo night, his freckles lit like tiny brands, and the mob tripped over its own anger trying to follow his dance.

* **Lifestyle:** tidy garret with folded capes, rune shavings, and too many mirrors.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, private “lane-dance” lessons.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

He counts success in **smiles behind him**. Runes are manners that shine.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** spans where runes won’t “take” (Severance static).
* **Weaknesses:** two-handed reach means no shield; **focus fire** hurts; limited rune uses.
* **Strengths:** **Giant’s Might** burst, **Cloud redirect**, **Stone charm**, **Action Surge** tempo, strong crowd presence.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**Femboy — เย้ายวน:**

> “Hands on my waist… lower—tactical, darling. When the bronze lights up, squeeze and glide with me.”

เขากระซิบสองแง่สามง่าม ใส่จังหวะหายใจให้ตามอย่างว่าง่าย แล้วเปิดช่องทางเหมือนปาฏิหาริย์

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** the rune-freckles sometimes sketch a **map** toward under-rails at midnight.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Borrowed Sigil:** a forger copies his Cloud rune on riot shields—unravel the counterfeit.
  2. **Giant’s Debt:** a hill-spirit demands he carry a vow along a silent span.
  3. **Mirror Line:** assassins study his redirects to strike allies; teach them to chase ghosts.
