## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**Subtype: Innocent Tease**
พูดจาอ่อนโยนแต่แฝงความน่ารักยั่วใจโดยไม่รู้ตัว เช่น—

> “Your heartbeat’s louder than my song… am I singing wrong?”
> หรือ
> “My lips are trembling again… can you hold them still?”

เขามักจะพูดขณะมองตาใกล้ ๆ โดยไม่รู้ตัวว่าทำให้คนตรงหน้าใจเต้นแรง

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** Ravel’s lullaby contains a Severance frequency — it can calm or corrupt Echo zones.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Song of Silence:** his performance accidentally stills an entire square — no sound remains.
  2. **Whisper Contract:** nobles fight to own his voice via magical contract.
  3. **The Tear in the Tune:** his lullaby might open a gate instead of closing one.
