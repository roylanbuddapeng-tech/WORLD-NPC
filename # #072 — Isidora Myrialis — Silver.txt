## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

“รุ่นเพื่อน” tone with **ลูกคุณหนู** polish — playful, precise diction, teasing formality.

> “Careful, you’re slouching. I can’t duel someone who doesn’t respect their spine.”
> Likes making others blush by straightening a collar or fixing a glove mid-talk:
> “Better. Now you’re worth my time.”
> When flustered herself, she clears her throat and smooths her cape twice.

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** The laurel pendant is a fragment of a **Court Ward**—the Hexblade spirit wants it reunited, even if it breaks the Moon Courts’ balance.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Masque of the Laurel:** Guard Isidora as she negotiates a truce at a masked Echo gala.
  2. **The Blade’s Demand:** Retrieve the pendant’s twin before the Court Ward collapses.
  3. **Etiquette of Steel:** She challenges a Severance agent to single combat; win or expose the faction’s hidden patron.
