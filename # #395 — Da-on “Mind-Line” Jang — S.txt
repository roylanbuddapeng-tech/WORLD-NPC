## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Mind-Thread Skirmisher)

* **Role:** **controller / bodyguard skirmisher**
* **Opener:** soft smile → steps to the seam; first poke with **Psionic Strike** to claim attention, **Protective Field** ready for bystanders.
* **Flow:** **Telekinetic Movement** tugs allies or civilians **30 ft** through a gap; **Action Surge** converts a safe hold into a clean pass window.
* **Finisher:** two-handed lunge as violet motes string along the haft; rain draws a razor-clean arrow through the crowd.

**Damage Flavor:** every strike pops a tiny violet ring on wet glass; the rings fade as people pass safely.

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** shameless flirt, precise footwork coach, whispers compliments mid-fight to rattle foes.
* **Ideal:** **Elegance as Tactic** — “If they watch me, they forget to panic.”
* **Bond:** keeps a ribbon from the first choir kid he escorted; kisses it before patrols.
* **Flaw:** loves flourish; risks one extra twirl when a simple stab would do.

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Former stage extra turned runner; learned crowd physics from balcony spotlights. On his first Echo night he “pulled” a stumbling elder with a thought and never stopped.

* **Lifestyle:** tidy garret of capes, chalk strings, and mirror shards.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, private “lane-dance” lessons.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

He measures victory by **how smoothly people slip behind him**. Pretty is just the paint on discipline.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** dead-quiet spans that swallow his mind-rings (Severance).
* **Weaknesses:** **24 HP**; limited psionic dice—must pace resources.
* **Strengths:** **telekinetic reposition**, **on-demand damage reduction**, **Action Surge** tempo, accurate spear work.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**Femboy — เย้ายวน:**

> “Hands on my waist… mm, lower—tactical, I promise. When I say ‘float,’ you glide with me.”

เขากระซิบใกล้หู ใช้คำกำกวมจนคนข้าง ๆ หน้าแดง แล้วพาเดินตามจังหวะได้อย่างว่าง่าย

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** his bell-bangle rings only near **forged rails**; on Severance spans it goes dead.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Mind-Map:** violet rings appear at midnight, pointing to a sealed under-bridge.
  2. **Borrowed Thought:** someone mimics his Protective Field to shield criminals—trace the thief.
  3. **Quiet Pull:** Telekinetic Movement fails on one bridge; discover who’s eating the rain’s voice.
