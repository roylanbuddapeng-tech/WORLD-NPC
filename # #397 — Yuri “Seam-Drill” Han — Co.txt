## 🎯 Combat Tactics (Drill Anchor / Crowd Controller)

* **Role:** **frontline defender / control via maneuvers**
* **Opener:** chalks a seam, steps in **spear+shield**; first heavy target gets **Menacing** to slow push; **Brace** holds the next surge at reach.
* **Flow:** **Trip Attack** to seat bullies on wet glass; calls breath counts and rotates allies through advantage spots; **Action Surge** opens a timed pass window.
* **Finisher:** two-hand spear thrust along the chalk line; rain beads into tidy arrows pointing “go.”

**Damage Flavor:** each maneuver clicks her bangle; droplets arrange into calligraphy strokes that fade as the lane clears.

## 💬 Personality

* **Traits:** patient teacher, precise corrections, quiet praise when rhythm is right.
* **Ideal:** Stewardship — “Position is kindness; the drill is how we keep it.”
* **Bond:** carries a strip of parchment from her mentor’s last lane-map.
* **Flaw:** refuses to retreat while anyone still crosses; absorbs too much blame.

## 🧭 Common Locations

* **Kingdom/Zone:** **Valeronnes — glass bridges, lock-stair aprons, roof-rails**
* **Threat Gradient:** **Wavering → Echo**
* **Encounter Framing:** **escort seam hold**, **riot peel via maneuvers**, **apex duel in rain**

## 📜 Background & Lifestyle

Dockside scribe turned formation coach; she learned to **draw** lanes before she held them. On Echo nights her brush became a spear, and her lines became promises.

* **Lifestyle:** spare loft of charts, chalk strings, and neatly folded capes.
* **Income:** city stipend, hazard pay, private formation clinics.

---

## 🧩 Morals & Ethics

Victory is **quiet footsteps behind her**. A clean lane is a kept promise.

---

## 😨 Fears / Weaknesses / Strengths

* **Fears:** spans where chalk won’t “take” (Severance stillness).
* **Weaknesses:** modest damage without maneuvers; limited superiority dice.
* **Strengths:** **AC 19**, **Brace/Trip/Menacing** control, **Action Surge** tempo, crisp spear+shield fundamentals.

## 💞 Interactions (Behavioral Style)

**รุ่นพี่ — calm & caring, faintly teasing**

> “Back strap—tighter. Two breaths. Eyes on the seam, not the neckline… good. Step when I say ‘pass.’”

เธอแตะข้อมือให้จังหวะจนใจนิ่ง แล้วคุณจะก้าวทันโดยไม่รู้ตัว

---

## 🤫 Secrets & Plot Hooks

* **Secret:** her jade pendant warms near **forged rails** and chills on **Severance-stilled** spans.
* **Hooks:**

  1. **Drill Under Fire:** teach two rookies mid-riot—success unlocks a safer market route.
  2. **Stolen Strokes:** counterfeit lane-calligraphy spreads; track the forger through rain-blurred glyphs.
  3. **Silent Diagram:** chalk won’t mark one bridge; find the anchor eating sound.
